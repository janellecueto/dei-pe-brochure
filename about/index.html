    <h1>ABOUT <small>THE COMPANY</small></h1>
</div>
<div class="container" id="about">
    <p>Dickerson Engineering, Inc (DEI) is a Professional Electrical Engineering firm providing electrical design services,
        for a variety of facilities including healthcare, data processing center, and commercial clients. </p>
    <p>DEI offers a complete package of design services from conceptual design through construction administration to
        produce a quality product. Our services include detailed working drawings, written specifications, coordination
        meetings, full construction administration services, and bid review assistance including a review of shop drawings
        and site observation trips with written reports. </p>
    <p>Joe Dickerson founded DEI in 1969 on the basis of his strong personal beliefs: honestly, integrity, hard work,
        and family values. Through his dedication and leadership, he has built a distinguished design team devoted to
        professionalism, growth, long term client relationships and quality services. DEI’s dedication to the field of
        electrical engineering and the people we serve is demonstrated by the reputation we have earned for quality services
        and client satisfaction.</p>
    <p>Our staff offers a highly specialized blend of expertise that includes electrical engineers, project managers,
        designers, and CAD technicians. DEI has licensed engineers, electrical engineers, and LEED accredited professional
        on staff to assure close coordination and successful completion of each project. Our goal is to design superior
        work tailored to meet the specific needs and budget considerations of each individual project. All project team
        members are committed to complete client satisfaction and will work closely with the client to assure coordination
        and attention to detail through all phases of the project. </p>
    <p>We have an extensive list of clients and extensive experience in the industry with more than 50 clients in the
        greater Chicagoland area, many of whom we have had relationships with for more than 25 years. This experience
        comes from our knowledge of codes and standards, electrical power distribution, stand-by emergency generators,
        design ingenuity, latest technological advances along with designing with the highest regard to human safety.
        This, along with our commitment to client satisfaction has allowed us to continue to grow our client base and
        remain the leader in electrical systems design. </p>
    <p>DEI has also been nationally recognized for its work in the industry, most recently by R&D Magazine with the 2010
        Lab of the Year Award and the American Society for Healthcare Engineering (ASHE) as a 2008 Vista Award recipient
        in the category of Hospital Renovation. We were also the electrical design engineers for Advocate Lutheran General
        Hospital’s Bed Replacement Tower, which was awarded LEED gold certification, making it the first Hospital in the
        Midwest to receive such a prestigious distinction. </p>
    <p>As uncertain as the future may be, DEI’s mission remains the same – “To invest in our people and new technology
        in order to remain a distinguished design team devoted to public safety, professionalism, growth, long term client
        relationships, and quality services.” </p>
